# Computer Use

Fetch this reference on demand with
`nodeRepl.write(await agent.documentation.get("computer-use"))`. It largely repeats
the resident Computer Use skill, so read it only when you need an argument shape or
a response field that page does not give.


Control native apps on the user's computer by reading or operating UI. Prefer a
purpose-built skill, connector, API or CLI when one can complete the task.

- Use `node_repl` (JavaScript) for all Computer Use actions.
- Do not use AppleScript, `osascript`, JXA, System Events, shell commands, or any
  other UI-automation technology unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Main agent only. Never delegate Computer Use to a subagent.
- Use only the APIs described here.

## Bootstrap every call

`mcp__node_repl__js` creates a fresh Worker per call. JavaScript globals, imports,
module cache and any binding do not survive into the next call, so `const app`
does **not** live past the end of the cell. The UI state itself does survive: the
host keeps each app's accessibility state and raster, so re-binding in the next
cell is cheap and does not re-observe.

The first executable statement of every CUA cell must be this bootstrap, and the
bootstrap and the actions must be in the **same** cell:

```js
const root =
  process.env.ZCODE_CUA_PLUGIN_ROOT ??
  process.env.ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT ??
  process.env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT;
const { join } = await import("node:path");
const { pathToFileURL } = await import("node:url");
const { setupComputerUseRuntime } = await import(
  pathToFileURL(join(root, "scripts", "computer-use-client.mjs")).href,
);
await setupComputerUseRuntime({ globals: globalThis });

const app = await agent.computerUse.getApp("Notes");
await app.click(42);
await app.getAXState();
```

`agent.computerUse.computer` exposes the low-level tool surface. Prefer the bound
API above; reach for a tool only for what the API does not express.

## Tool arguments

Every tool takes **one** arguments object; the names below are its keys, not
positional parameters. Arguments are validated strictly — an undeclared key is
refused with `unrecognized_keys`, and a missing required key reports
`expected object, received undefined` for that field — so do not invent options
and do not flatten a nested value into the top level:

```js
// right
await agent.computerUse.computer.get_app_state({
  app_ref: { bundle_id: "com.apple.Notes" },
  include_screenshot: true,
});
// wrong: `app_ref` is missing, so the union for it reports "received undefined"
await agent.computerUse.computer.get_app_state({
  bundle_id: "com.apple.Notes",
  include_screenshot: true,
});
```

```
list_apps({})
list_windows({app_ref})
get_app_state({app_ref, include_screenshot?=false, disable_diffing?=false})

left_click({target, mouse_button?="left", click_count?=1, modifiers?="",
           strategy?="auto", app_ref?, return_state?="none"})
left_click_drag({from_target, to, modifiers?="", app_ref?, return_state?="none"})
scroll({target, scroll_direction, scroll_amount, strategy?="auto", app_ref?,
       return_state?="none"})

type({text, target?, app_ref?, strategy?="auto", return_state?="none"})
set_value({target, value, strategy?="auto", app_ref?, return_state?="none"})
select_text({target, text_range?, app_ref?, return_state?="none"})
key({text, repeat?, hold_seconds?, app_ref?, strategy?="auto", return_state?="none"})
paste({text, format?="text", app_ref?, return_state?="none"})
perform_action({target, action, app_ref?, return_state?="none"})

request_access({capabilities?})
stop_computer_control({reason?})
```

- `app_ref` — `{name: "Notes"}` for a display name, `{bundle_id:
  "com.apple.Notes"}` for an identifier, or `{pid: 1234}`. Add `window_id` to
  bind a single window. A bare string is read as a **bundle id**, never as a
  display name. On Windows a display name is the name the OS lists (the
  Start-menu name), not a window title.
- `target` — `{type: "element", index}` for an accessibility element, or
  `{type: "coordinate", x, y}` for a raster pixel, optionally with `frame_id`. An
  element index addresses the most recent observation of that app, so pass
  `app_ref` with the action to say which app it belongs to. A `frame_id` names one
  exact raster; omit it and the coordinate binds the session's most recent
  actionable raster. The bound API supplies one when this cell took a raster and
  omits it otherwise — either way you never handle a frame id.
- `scroll_direction` — `up | down | left | right`. `scroll_amount` is in pages,
  clamped to 0–100.
- `text_range` — `[start, length]` into the element's current value. `select_text`
  without it selects the whole value.
- `strategy` — `auto | a11y | event`. `auto` prefers accessibility and falls back
  to synthetic events; the other two force one path. `event` sends global input and
  requires the target app (and `window_id`, when given) to be frontmost already —
  it never activates anything, so on a background app it is refused with
  `FOREGROUND_REQUIRED` and nothing is sent. Target an element instead.
- `return_state` — `compact | full | none` (default `none`). Returns the app state
  in the same call, saving a separate observation. The bound API does its own
  observing, so this only matters when you call a tool directly.
- `modifiers` — a `+`-separated chord held for the duration of the action, e.g.
  `"cmd+shift"`.
- `repeat` — how many times `key` re-sends the chord. Use it instead of a loop of
  `pressKey` calls.


## Tool results

The bound API returns typed values. `computer.*` instead hands back what the tool
itself produced, after one unwrapping step, so a call resolves to one of three
shapes:

- **The parsed payload.** A result carrying exactly one text block is
  `JSON.parse`d for you, so you get the tool's own shape with no `content` to
  walk. `list_apps` and `list_windows` land here.
- **A plain string.** The same single-text-block result, when its text is not
  JSON. `get_app_state` without a screenshot lands here, so you get the rendered
  tree and nothing else: the `structuredContent` that carried `state_id` and the
  element rows does not survive the unwrap. Use a bound app's `elements()` for
  that table.
- **The raw MCP envelope,** `{ content: [...] }`. Returned unchanged for anything
  else, most often because `include_screenshot: true` added an image block. Read
  the blocks out of `content`; there is no parsed payload, and the envelope also
  carries host-only fields this contract does not cover.

So branch on the shape instead of assuming one:

```js
const wins = await agent.computerUse.computer.list_windows({
  app_ref: { name: "Notes" },
});
nodeRepl.write(`windows: ${JSON.stringify(wins)}`);       // parsed payload

const shot = await agent.computerUse.computer.get_app_state({
  app_ref: { name: "Notes" },
  include_screenshot: true,
});
const image = shot.content.find((block) => block.type === "image");  // envelope
```

Never pass a whole envelope to `nodeRepl.write` or `JSON.stringify`: the image
block is large, and a bound app's `getAXStateAndScreenshot()` already submits the
picture for you.

## Windows

A capture is always scoped to one window of one app, so a multi-window app needs
you to say which window. `list_windows` returns one row per window, in the app's
own window order:

- `window_id` — stable integer. Pass it back inside `app_ref` to address that
  window.
- `title` — the window title; `""` or `null` for a window that carries none.
  `""` means the window has an `AXTitle` that is empty — a Qt or custom-drawn
  panel typically looks like this. `null` means the title could not be read at
  all, which happens both for an AX window whose `AXTitle` read fails and for a
  row the broker merged in from CoreGraphics, so it does not tell the two apart.
  Use `subrole` for that distinction.
- `subrole` — the window's `AXSubrole`, present only on a real AX window. A row
  merged in from CoreGraphics (a WindowServer surface the accessibility tree does
  not expose) has no `subrole` at all, so the field's presence is what separates
  "a window you can bind and operate" from "a leftover surface". Its own value
  discriminates weakly: a survey of 34 windows across 30 apps found 31 of them
  reporting `AXStandardWindow`, with `AXDialog` the only other value that carried
  information. macOS only.
- `text_preview` — a content sample for a window with no usable title: the first
  few strings found inside it, joined and truncated. **Never an identifier.** The
  order comes from the accessibility child order, which is creation order and
  carries no semantic guarantee — in the same app a dialog yields its heading
  while a main window yields toolbar noise. It is collected only when `title` is
  empty, omitted when nothing could be collected, and it can contain whatever the
  window displays, including the user's own data. Read it as a hint for choosing
  which window to observe, then confirm by observing that window. macOS only.
- `bounds` — `[x, y, width, height]` in global screen points. Diagnostic only:
  these must never be copied into a coordinate target.
- `main` — the app's AX main window. `focused` — the app's AX focused (key)
  window. Neither one means the app is the system-frontmost application;
  `listApps()` reports that as `active`.
- `onscreen` — `false` marks a window CoreGraphics still owns after the app closed
  its real windows. That row is neither user-visible nor operable, so skip it when
  choosing a target. It carries a different meaning from occluded or minimized,
  both of which stay operable and stay `true`.
- `index` — the row's position in this response, not an element index and not a
  window id.

Bind a window and every call in that cell stays on it:

```js
const app = await agent.computerUse.getApp({ pid: 23192, window_id: 27367 });
await app.getAXState();
```

`agent.computerUse.getWindow(target, windowId)` binds the same way and reads
better when the target is a name. Either form throws `STALE_STATE` when that
window cannot be resolved, instead of quietly capturing a different one.

Without a `window_id` the app's main/key window is captured, and that resolution
runs again on **every** observation. A modal that opened since the last
observation therefore becomes the captured window. Element indices are
per-window and are renumbered by each observation, so an index taken before the
window changed can address an unrelated control afterwards.

So when an action fails unexpectedly, or the tree reads like a different part of
the app, check the observation's `window` block first: a modal dialog appears
there as the captured window. Read its contents, then decide. Dismiss it only
when it is not the intended target — press Escape, or use the dialog's own cancel
control — and observe again afterwards. When the dialog *is* the task, act on it.
Judging "my previous action worked" from a tree that turns out to be the dialog's
is the specific mistake this section exists to prevent: the element you were
looking for is absent because you are reading a different window, not because
the action removed it.


## Workflow

After performing one or more UI actions, call `getAXState()` before deciding what
to do next: that is how you see what your actions did.

An element index addresses the app's most recent observation, so several actions
may reuse one index without re-observing between them — click an index, then type
into it, in the same cell. Observing renumbers the tree, so take indices from the
newest one. A vanished element fails closed with `ELEMENT_UNAVAILABLE`.

The accessibility tree comes back as a diff only against a tree this cell already
showed you, listing the removed, added and changed elements; the omitted rows are
unchanged and their indices stay valid. The first tree after binding, and the
first after a screenshot-only observation, are always complete. Pass
`{ disableDiffing: true }` for a full tree at any point. If a standalone
`getAXState()` reports no change, do not immediately repeat it without an
intervening action.

Minimize round trips while keeping the state fresh:

- Batch deterministic actions and the resulting `getAXState()` into one call.
- `agent.computerUse.getApp(...)` returns the binding and displays nothing; call
  `getAXState()` when you need to see the state.
- Prefer a directly relevant result already visible in the current state over
  opening broader intermediate UI such as "Show All".
- Once the requested result is visibly present, stop exploring and respond.

```typescript
await target.click(42);
await target.setValue(42, "openai.com");
await target.pressKey("Return");
await target.typeText("hello");
await target.scroll(42, "down", 1);
await target.scroll([640, 480], "down", 1);
await target.selectText(42, "hello");
await target.performSecondaryAction(42, "Expand");
await target.getAXState();
```

## Output

- For text, use `nodeRepl.write(...)`. For images, `nodeRepl.emitImage(...)`.
- `getAXState()`, `getScreenshot()`, `getAXStateAndScreenshot()`,
  `agent.computerUse.getState()` and `agent.computerUse.listApps()`
  **display their own result**; `agent.computerUse.getApp(...)` does not — it binds only. Never pass their return value to `write` or
  `emitImage`: a second raster in one result breaks the one-raster rule and the
  frame is removed entirely, leaving no picture at all. Pass `{ emit: false }` to
  suppress the display and still get the value back.
- Action methods display nothing and resolve to `undefined` on success.

## Errors

Actions resolve to `undefined` when they succeed and throw `ComputerUseError`
when they do not. The fields you act on:

- `code` — `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `NOT_AUTHORIZED`, `APP_NOT_FOUND`,
  `AMBIGUOUS_APP`, `LAUNCH_FAILED`, `INVALID_APP`, `ELEMENT_UNAVAILABLE`,
  `STALE_STATE`, `NOT_SETTABLE`, `NOT_SELECTABLE`, `ACTION_UNAVAILABLE`,
  `FOREGROUND_REQUIRED`, `CONTROLLER_BUSY`, `CONTROL_STOPPED`, `SCREEN_LOCKED`,
  `HELPER_UNAVAILABLE`, `VERSION_MISMATCH`, `TIMEOUT`,
  `STRUCTURED_STATE_UNAVAILABLE`, `INTERNAL`.
- `actionSent` — whether the action may already have reached the app. Retry a
  non-idempotent action only when this is `false`; otherwise observe first.
- `FOREGROUND_REQUIRED` comes only from `strategy: "event"` (and from `paste` on a
  background app). On macOS nothing in this surface can bring an app forward, so do
  not retry it and do not look for an activation call: switch to an element target,
  `setValue`, or an accessibility action, which all work on a background app.
- `retry` — `"reobserve"`, `"retry"` or `"never"`.

```js
try {
  await app.performSecondaryAction(7, "Show Menu");
} catch (e) {
  if (e.code === "ACTION_UNAVAILABLE") {
    await app.getAXState({ disableDiffing: true });   // the tree lists each element's actions
  } else if (e.code === "CONTROLLER_BUSY") {
    nodeRepl.write(`another ZCode Computer Use session owns control: ${e.details.owner}`);
  } else if (e.actionSent) {
    await app.getAXState();                            // may already have landed; look first
  } else throw e;
}
```

`CONTROLLER_BUSY` is never retryable. Report the owner from the error and ask the
user to close the other session. Stop immediately after `agent.computerUse.stop()`, a kill
switch, or a permission refusal, and do not switch to a different UI-automation
technology after an access refusal.

## Notes

- `elements()` returns the element table as data, including the rows the rendered
  tree trimmed for length, so filter it in JS instead of guessing a hidden index.
  It observes without displaying anything, which costs one broker round trip and
  makes the next `getAXState()` return a full tree rather than a diff — reach for
  it when the tree said `indices are sparse`, not on every turn.
- A container can also report only part of its children, and that is a different
  limit from the one above: the header says `showing A-B of N items`, and those
  rows never entered the observation, so `elements()` does not recover them
  either. This is what a long list or a spreadsheet grid looks like — the rows you
  need may simply have no index. Reach the rest through the app itself: scroll the
  container and observe again, or move the app's own selection (arrow keys, a
  Name Box, a search field) and read the value back from the focused element.
- Prefer element-index actions over coordinate actions whenever an accessibility
  element is available. They are semantic, precise, background-safe and do not
  steal the user's focus. Fall back to a screenshot and coordinates only when
  accessibility cannot locate or express the target.
- Coordinates are integer pixels of the **latest returned raster**. Take them only
  by looking at that raster. Element and window bounds in the tree are diagnostic
  global screen points and must never be used as a coordinate. The SDK binds the
  raster internally; you never pass a frame id.
- A pointer action can be accepted and still do nothing where you aimed. Some apps
  ignore the position carried by a synthesized pointer event and act on wherever the
  real pointer happens to sit, so the same coordinate produces a different result
  depending on where the user left the mouse. The next observation says so with
  `[effect_evidence unchanged]`; when it does, **do not repeat the coordinate** —
  act on an element index, or drive the app from the keyboard (arrow keys,
  shortcuts, or a value typed into a field), which lands on a background app.
- The tree always lists each element's `actions`. `performSecondaryAction` accepts
  only an action the element advertises — do not guess one.
- `selectText` locates text inside an editable element. Use `prefix`/`suffix` to
  disambiguate repeated matches and `selectionType` to place the cursor instead of
  selecting. An ambiguous match is refused rather than resolved to the first hit.
- `pressKey` accepts xdotool-style keysyms as well as short names: `"a"`,
  `"Return"`, `"Tab"`, `"Control_L+a"`, `"super+c"`, `"Up"`. macOS uses `cmd`;
  Linux and Windows use `ctrl`. `{ holdSeconds }` holds the key or chord.
- Use `paste` for rich text, or for a target `setValue` cannot set; for plain text
  into a settable element `setValue` is the better path. It borrows the system
  pasteboard and restores the user's clipboard afterwards. A paste no app reads
  fails with a timeout rather than reporting success. A paste shortcut cannot name
  a target field, so it lands wherever the keyboard focus is — check the result.
- There is no need to open or launch apps; `agent.computerUse.getApp(...)` launches the app in
  the background if it is not already running. There is no separate launch tool.
  Its argument is a display name, a
  bundle identifier, or the same `{name|bundle_id|pid}` object the tools take.
  For a string the SDK sends a
  dotted, space-free string as `bundle_id` and anything else as `name`, and
  retries with the other field once if the app is not found, so either form
  works. There is no path form: `app_ref` has no path field.
  Nothing here fronts a window or takes the user's focus, except on Windows:
  launching a non-packaged app takes focus, and `include_screenshot=true` on a
  minimized window restores it. A minimized window's tree stays fully usable, so
  keep the default unless you need pixels.
- Observations wait an appropriate amount of time before capturing. Do **not**
  pause or delay (no `setTimeout`) before getting UI state; rely on that wait.
- When the state does not show what you expected, observe once more before trying
  a different approach: an animation or a load may still have been in flight.

Persist until the request is fully completed end to end. Attempting an action is
not completion: verify that the returned UI state visibly shows the requested
result. If an action leaves the state unchanged, produces no results, or only
reaches an intermediate page, try another approach. Respond only after the
requested state is visibly present, or explain a concrete blocker you cannot
resolve.
